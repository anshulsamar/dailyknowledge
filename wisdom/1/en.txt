Letting Go of Control

Many have a problem with letting go of control. This causes anxiety, restlessness and soured relationships.

Wake up and see, are you really in control? What are you in control of?

Perhaps a tiny part of your waking state! Isn't that so?

* You're not in control when you're sleeping or dreaming.

* You're not in control of the thoughts and emotions coming up in you. You may choose to express them or not, but they come to you without your prior permission!

Most of the functions of your body aren't in your control.

If you think you're in control of all the events in your life, in the world, or in the universe-- that's a joke!

When you look at things from this angle, you don't need to be afraid of losing control because you have none.

Whether you realize it or not, when you let go of your sense of control, that's when you truly relax. Your attachment to your identity and the roles you play doesn't let you totally relax and keeps you restricted.
